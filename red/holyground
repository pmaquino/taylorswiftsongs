Here as we wait
Seek Your face
Come and make Your throne upon our praise
Here in this place
Have Your way
The moment that we see You, we are changed
Show us Your glory
Show us Your glory
In wonder and surrender we fall down
Show us Your glory
Show us Your glory
Let every burning heart be holy ground
Holy ground
Here, not by power
Not by might
But only by the cross we come alive
Here, we're undone
Overcome
By heaven's love revealed before our eyes
Show us Your glory
Show us Your glory
In wonder and surrender we fall down
Show us Your glory
Show us Your glory
Let every burning heart be holy ground
Show us, show us Your glory
Show us Your glory
In wonder and surrender we fall down
Show us Your glory
Show us Your glory
Let every burning heart be holy ground
Come and have Your way
Have Your way

Jesus, you change everything
Lives healed
Hope found

Jesus, you change everything
You change everything
(Jesus You change everything)
Thank the Lord of Jesus, oh Jesus
Chains fall
Fear bow
Here, now
Jesus, you change everything
Lives healed
Hope found
Here, now
Jesus, you change everything
