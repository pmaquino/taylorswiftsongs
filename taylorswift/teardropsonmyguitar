Drew looks at me,
I fake a smile so he won't see,
What I want, what I need,
And everything that we should be,
I'll bet she's beautiful,
That girl he talks about,
And she's got everything that I've had to live without,
Drew talks to me,
AndI laugh 'cause it's just so funny,
That I can't even see
Anyone when he's with me,
He says he's so in love,
He's finally got it right,
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night,
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar,
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star,
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do
Drew walks by me,
Can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes so perfectly,
The kind of flawless I wish I could be,
She better hold him tight,
Give him all her love,
Look in those beautiful eyes,
And know she's lucky 'cause,
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar,
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star,
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do
So I'll drive home alone,
As I turn out the light,
I'll put his picture down,
And maybe get some sleep tonight,
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar,
The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart,
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do
He's the time taken up,
But there's never enough,
And he's all the I need to fall into,
Drew looks at me,
I fake a smile so he won't see.
